      For directions please click <a href=""directions.html"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Our rooms availabe include, twin rooms, single rooms,
       double rooms and family rooms. For more details see our 
      <a href=""information.html"">information page</a>, where you will also find our room rates.</p>
<p>Some facilities and services we offer are laundry facilities,
      kitchen, dining room, games room, wifi service and television room. 
      A sports ground and playground are also available across the road from our establishment.  
      To see more click <a href=""information.html"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Local attractions include the glorious banna beach, Ardfert cathedral, 
      the beautiful seaside town of Ballyheigue and many more. You can view a
      complete and more detailed list, also on our <a href=""information.html"">
      information</a> page.</p>
<p>Check in times are between 1pm and 3pm. Check out time is 12pm. We are
      checked by <a href=""https://www.bandbireland.com"">B&amp;B Ireland</a> and accept
      credit and debit cards as forms of payment, along with cash and cheques.</p>
<p>We operate in euro, as that is the official currency in Ireland.
      Our local weather is usually relativly pleasant but do expect rain if
      you come to our part of the world. We would advise checking the local
      weather forecast when planning your trip as the weather can sometimes
      be unpredicatble.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we do not accomodate for pets in our bed and breakfast.
      If a guest has a visual impairment and requires a guide dog, we would
      be more than willing to accomodate them, in any way we can, once notice 
      is given, when <a href=""bookings.html"">booking</a> a room. We also have
      a no smoking policy in our rooms but we do provide smoking facilities 
      outdoors.</p>
